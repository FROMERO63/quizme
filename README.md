## Description

This motivation for this project was to create a quiz that could help coding students to learn coding information
I wanted to allow the user to test their knowledge while being timed.
I also added a feature for the user to check high scores.
This solved the problem studying being boring and allowing a more interactive way to study coding.
Some things that I learned in this challenge were theme switching, working with CSS to create a cohesive theme, using countdowns, incrementing and decrementing stats and time.
I had difficulty actually getting the scores to stay on the screen after refreshing and also with getting the timer to stop at 0. I used the clearInterval but it was not working inside the function. I will be asking in my next tutoring session for assistance.

## Installation

This website was built from scratch. I added all the html, css, and javascript.

## Usage

Timer feature starts once the test begins and counts down from 60 seconds

Current score increases as you get questions correct while 10 seconds are deducted everytime a question is answered incorrectly

Upon completion the user can enter their initials to add to the highscores page

Upon clicking the highscores button, you can view highscores
